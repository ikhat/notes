# [Ivan's notes](https://ikhat.gitbook.io/)

I will use this to house my general notes. This repository is linked to a [Gitbook](https://ikhat.gitbook.io/), making this information more easily accessible (and prettier) on the internet. 


The idea to create this thing was inspired by [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/).
