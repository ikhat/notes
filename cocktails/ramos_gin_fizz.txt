Ramos Gin Fizz

1.5 oz   gin
0.5 oz   lemon juice
0.5 oz   lime juice
1 oz     simple syrup
2 oz     heavy cream
~3 drops orange blossom water
1		 egg white

~2 drops vanilla extract (optional)

Dry shake to combine ingredients and emulsify egg. Then shake with ice (preferably a few big pieces) for a long time. Longer than you think you would have to. 

Pour into a Collins glass and add some club soda while stirring vigourously (it's nice to rinse the shaker with soda to get the extra foam).
