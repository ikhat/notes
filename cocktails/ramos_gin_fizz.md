# Ramos Gin Fizz

## Ingredients

* 1.5 oz   gin
* 0.5 oz   lemon juice
* 0.5 oz   lime juice
* 1 oz     simple syrup
* 2 oz     heavy cream
* ~3 drops orange blossom water
* 1		 egg white
* club soda
* ~2 drops vanilla extract (optional)

## Preparation

Dry shake to combine ingredients and emulsify egg. Then shake with ice (preferably a few big pieces) for a long time. Longer than you think you would have to. 

Pour into a Collins glass and add some club soda while stirring vigourously (it's nice to rinse the shaker with soda to get the extra foam).
