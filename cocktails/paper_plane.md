# Paper Plane (my way)

## Ingredients

* 3/4 oz bourbon
* 3/4 oz Amaro Nonino
* 3/4 oz lemon juice
* 3/4 oz Campari
* 1 dash orange bitters (optional)

## Preparation

Shake, serve in a coupe or Manhattan glass. 
Optionally garnish with a twist.

## Notes

The traditional recipe will use Aperol in place of Campari, but I prefer the Campari. It makes it boozier and grapefruitier.
