# Android Home Screen

[Here's my Android homescreen](https://i.imgur.com/nevVV8d.png)

## Goal

The goal of the setup is to make anything I might use regularly no more than two taps away from the home screen. There's a lot of gesture functionality built into it.

It's optimized for functionality rather than aesthetics, but I'm going to make has a pretty stripped-down aesthetic anyway.

## Parts

* [The wallpaper.](https://i.imgur.com/6mDQLAb.png)

* **The widget**

 Made by me with [Kustom Widget Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kustom.widget). The font is Helvetica Bold.
	* Tapping on the time brings up the Clock app, which I use for alarms and timers.
	* Tapping on the date brings up Google Calendar.
	* The "81" is the battery percentage, and tapping on it brings up battery settings.
	* The "11" is the local temperature in Celsius, and tapping on it brings up Google's weather forecast (which you can do by opening this link: `dynact://velour/weather/ProxyActivity`).
	* The magnifying glass brings up the Google app.

* **Dock icons**

 Each of these icons is a folder, set to launch the first application in the folder when you tap on the icon and open the folder when you swipe on the icon. The icons are [Compacticons](https://www.deviantart.com/tatosxl/art/Compacticons-HD-for-Android-586892801). 

 In order:
	* **Camera icon** 

	 Tap opens the Google camera app. Swipe opens a folder of another camera app, the Imgur app, Google Lens. 
	* **Chrome icon**

	 Tap opens Chrome. Swipe opens a folder of shopping/buying-things apps, like Amazon, Uber (Eats), Starbucks, etc. 
	* **Envelope icon**

	 Tap opens Gmail. No folder under this one at the moment. 
	* **SMS icon**

	 Tap opens my SMS app of choice [Textra](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textra). Swipe opens a folder of communications apps like Facebook Messenger Lite, WhatsApp, Hangouts, Discord, etc.).
	* **Phone icon**

	 Tap opens the phone. Swipe opens a folder with just phone and contacts in it at the moment. Rarely use this folder, so I might repurpose it somehow. 
	* **Notes icon**

	 Tap opens my podcast app of choice [Podcast Republic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.itunestoppodcastplayer.app). Swipe opens a folder of Spotify, PowerAmp, Bandcamp, Shazam, and an audiobook app.
* **Dots** 

 Each of these is also a folder, but they work the opposite way; tapping on the dot opens the folder, while swiping opens the first app in the folder. This way I can have quick access to a folder of frequently-used apps, and instant access to the one I used most in each folder.
	* **Left dot**

	 Games. The ones I use most frequently. These are all time passing games that I usually play on public transit while my attention is on a podcast. Nothing fancy. 
	* **Middle dot**

	 My 12 most used apps. I've had some version of this three-dots setup for a while, and over that time I have slowly refined these 12 apps. I know exactly where each icon is in the folder by muscle memory. My reddit app of choice ([Joey](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=o.o.joey)) opens when you swipe on the dot. 
	* **Right dot**

	 File management apps of various forms. A gallery app, Google Photos, Dropbox, Google Drive, Amaze file browser, and Join. 
* **Gestures**

 Nova Launcher allows you to assign actions to certain gestures performed on the home screen. This is good, because it allows you to "hide" functionality. 
	* Swiping down from anywhere brings down the notifications drawer. 
	* Tapping then swiping down brings down the quick settings tiles. I also have an app that lets you customize the quick settings tiles a bit, so I have a calculator in there for example. 
	* Tapping then swiping up brings up the Google App. 
	* Two-finger swipe down brings up Android settings. 
	* Two-finger swipe up brings up Nova Launcher settings. 
* **[Sesame](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ninja.sesame.app.edge)**
	* Pressing the home button on the home screen it brings up Sesame, an app which essentially functions like a Spotlight search on the phone. Anything you want to do that isn't accessible in the ways listed above is a few keystrokes away via Sesame. For example, I can use Sesame to open Joey to a specific subreddits, open a particular settings subsection, message or email or call specific people, start a stopwatch, search within the Wikipedia or Ebay app, open Google maps centred at my home, and so on. It's amazing.
