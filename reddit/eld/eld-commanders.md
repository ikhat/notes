Here are all of the new legendary creatures in Throne of Eldraine, with links to some resources and the official discussion threads for each new commander. These threads will also be linked in the sidebar (and the "New ELD Commanders" text above the images is a link to this post). 

Please extend your gratitude to /u/Tripike1, who made the lovely new sidebar images. 

Please let me know (with a reply to this post) if you see any errors in this post.
