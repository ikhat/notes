This is the official discussion thread for this new Magic 2020 commander. For the next little while we'll ask discussion about brewing decks with this commander to stay in this thread, or at least be cross-posted to this thread. The idea is for this thread to be a resource for anyone looking to build around this commander in the future.

This thread will also be linked to in the sidebar, and in a stickied megathread collecting all the new commanders, so that people can easily find it for at least the next three months.
