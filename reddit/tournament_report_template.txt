<!-----INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
The purpose of this document is to provide a simple, well-formatted template
for tourament reports on reddit. It seems like most people who post tournament
reports on reddit don't realize that people might want to read them, and 
they end up a badly formatted mess. 

I have structured this template so that you, the tournament report writer
should only be replacing expressions that are surrounded by <angle brackets>.

Some specific points:

- If the decklist is not long enough for your deck, copy/paste to add lines.

- Don't delete any trailing spaces. Reddit's markdown needs two spaces at the
  end of a line to make a single line break. So with the sideboarding lists,
  for example, the double spaces at the end of the lines need to stay there
  to preserve the formatting.

- Don't add or delete any line breaks, other than in the text of your 
  descriptions of games of course. 

- Don't delete any asterisks or # symbols. They're part of the formatting. 

- Copy the match template as many times as necessary, deleting the dashed 
  dividers between them of course.

- Delete this section of introductory remarks.
