# Balsamic Chicken Thighs

## Ingredients

- 4 chicken thighs (boneless skinless, ideally)
- 2-4 cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- salt and lots of pepper

## Preparation

- **At least 4 hours in advance**
	- Mince/crush the garlic.
	- Combine everything in a freezer bag, massage a bit, then marinate in the fridge.
    - Marinading overnight doesn't seem to be necessary, but is ideal.  
     

- **Cooking**
	- Preheat oven to 375. 
    - Dump everything into a small baking dish. Big enough that the chicken has some space, but small enough that the marinade has some depth.
    - Bake for about 45 minutes, basting once or twice as you go.
