# Pancakes

Makes 16 4-inch pancakes.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 3 tbsp sugar
- 4 tsp baking powder
- 0.5 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 large eggs
- 0.25 cup + 1 tsp vegetable oil
- 1.5 cups milk
- 0.5 tsp vanilla extract

## Preparation

- **Batter**
	- Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. 
	- Whisk eggs and 0.25 cup oil in second bowl until well combined. 
	- Whisk milk and vanilla into egg mixture. 
	- Add egg mixture to flour mixture and stir gently until just combined (it should remain lumpy with a few streaks of flour). 
	- Let it sit for 10 minutes before cooking.


- **Cooking**
	- Heat 1/2 tsp oil in a nonstick pan over medium-low heat until shimmering. Using a paper towel, carefully wipe oil around pan, leaving a thin film on the bottom and sides of the pan. 
	- Drop 1 tbsp batter in center of pan. If the pancake is pale golden brown after 1 minute, the pan is ready. If not, adjust heat accordingly
	- Using quarter-cup measuring cup, portion batter into pan, leaving space between them. If necessary, gently spread batter into 4-inch rounds. 
	- Cook until edges are set, first sides are golden brown, and bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, 2 to 3 minutes. 
	- Flip them, and continue to cook until second sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer. 

- Hold them warm in a 200 degree oven as you cook.
